# Expert Doctor

Go Health A.I Repository

## Overview

This repository is part of the Go Health project, which aims to leverage artificial intelligence to provide expert medical insights and diagnostics.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Diagnostics**: Uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze pataient data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for both patients and healthcare providers.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## AI Process
The artificial intelligence API in Go Health performs diagnostics in three steps:

- **User Input**: The user submits a textual description of their symptoms or pains. The API is designed to handle cases where the patient may not clearly know what they are experiencing.
- **Checklist Generation**: Based on the provided symptoms, the API generates a checklist of options that may resemble possible medical conditions related to the reported symptoms.
- **Disease Classification**: The data from the checklist is analyzed to classify and identify a potential disease. The system uses machine learning models to provide a suggested diagnosis.
